description: Rules for matching reference designs exactly
---

- Do not add features, sections, or content not present in the reference image
- Match the reference exactly — do not "improve" the design
- If the user provides CSS classes or style tokens, use them verbatim
- Keep code clean but don't over-abstract — inline Tailwind classes are fine
- When comparing screenshots, be specific about what's wrong (e.g., "heading is 32px but reference shows ~24px", "gap between cards is 16px but should be 24px")
