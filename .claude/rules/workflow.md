description: Iterative workflow for recreating website designs from reference images
---

When the user provides a reference image (screenshot) and optionally some CSS classes or style notes:

1. **Generate** a single `index.html` file using Tailwind CSS (via CDN). Include all content inline — no external files unless requested.
2. **Screenshot** the rendered page using Puppeteer (`npx puppeteer screenshot index.html --fullpage` or equivalent). If the page has distinct sections, capture those individually too.
3. **Compare** your screenshot against the reference image. Check for mismatches in:
   - Spacing and padding (measure in px)
   - Font sizes, weights, and line heights
   - Colors (exact hex values)
   - Alignment and positioning
   - Border radii, shadows, and effects
   - Responsive behavior
   - Image/icon sizing and placement
4. **Fix** every mismatch found. Edit the HTML/Tailwind code.
5. **Re-screenshot** and compare again.
6. **Repeat** steps 3–5 until the result is within ~2–3px of the reference everywhere.

Do NOT stop after one pass. Always do at least 2 comparison rounds. Only stop when the user says so or when no visible differences remain.
